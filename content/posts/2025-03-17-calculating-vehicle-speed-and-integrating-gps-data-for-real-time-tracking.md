**Introduction**
In this final part, we will integrate all components to measure the speed of vehicles in front of you. We will also use GPS data to enhance accuracy.

---

**1. Calculating Speed**
To calculate the speed, you need to measure the distance traveled by the vehicle over time.

```python
import time

previous_time = time.time()
previous_distance = None

def calculate_distance(bbox):
    # Custom function to calculate distance based on bbox size
    # This is a placeholder for the actual distance calculation logic
    return bbox[2] - bbox[0]

def calculate_speed(distance_initial, distance_final, time_elapsed):
    distance_change = distance_final - distance_initial
    speed_m_s = distance_change / time_elapsed
    speed_kmh = speed_m_s * 3.6
    return speed_kmh

```

**2. Integrating GPS Data**
Use the smartphone’s GPS to get your vehicle’s speed. This can be done through various Android APIs or libraries.

```python
# Placeholder for getting the vehicle's speed from GPS
def get_my_vehicle_speed():
    return 50  # Assume a constant speed for demonstration

```

**3. Combining Everything**
Combine all the components to calculate the relative speed of the vehicle in front.

```python
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    results = model.predict(source=frame)
    bboxes = extract_bboxes(results)
    outputs = deepsort.update(bboxes)

    current_time = time.time()

    for output in outputs:
        bbox = output[:4]
        track_id = output[4]

        current_distance = calculate_distance(bbox)
        if previous_distance is not None:
            time_elapsed = current_time - previous_time
            relative_speed = calculate_speed(previous_distance, current_distance, time_elapsed)
            my_vehicle_speed = get_my_vehicle_speed()
            front_vehicle_speed = my_vehicle_speed + relative_speed
            print(f'Front Vehicle Speed: {front_vehicle_speed} km/h')

        previous_time = current_time
        previous_distance = current_distance

```

**4. Enhancing Accuracy**

- **Calibration**: Calibrate your system to improve accuracy.
- **Frame Rate**: Ensure the video processing frame rate is high to minimize latency.
**Conclusion**
By following this series, you have learned how to build a system to measure the speed of vehicles in front of you using a smartphone. This involves capturing video, detecting and tracking vehicles, and calculating their speed using real-time data.
